# Intro-to-programmming-projects
My projects for the Introduction to computer and Programming course. All are written in C except for the snake game, which is in C++.

**UTKala and advanced UTKala**: A command line shop where you can buy, sell and rate all the goods available

**Pentagool**: a modified version of Pentago game with graphics.
